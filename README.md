## Project Files
The repository contains the following files:

- `Car_data.xlsx`: Excel file containing the original data, cleaned data, various analyses, and the interactive dashboard.

## Data Cleaning Process
- Removed duplicates to ensure data integrity.
- Handled missing values appropriately to avoid skewing the analysis.
- Corrected inconsistencies in data entry for accurate analysis.

## Data Analysis
Excel was used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Pivot tables and formulas were utilized for in-depth analysis. Key findings include:

- Quantity sold by dealer ID.
- Profits for Hudson model cars by dealer ID.
- Profit by year and dealer ID.
- Profit by date and model.

## Data Visualization
The visualizations created include:

- Quantity Sold by Dealer ID
- Sum of Profits for Hudson model cars by Dealer ID
- Profit by Year and Dealer ID
- Profit by Date and Model



## Insights and Recommendations
- Dealer 1301 has the highest quantity sold.
- Dealer 1224 has the highest profit for the Hudson model cars.
- The year 2018 shows higher profits for most dealers compared to 2019.

Recommendations include focusing marketing efforts on high-performing dealers and car models, and investigating factors leading to lower sales in certain dealers to improve their performance.

## Conclusion
The analysis provided valuable insights into car model sales performance and dealer effectiveness. The visualizations and dashboard effectively present these insights, making it easier to understand and act upon them.

## Future Work or Suggestions
- Conduct further analysis to understand the factors influencing sales performance.
- Explore additional data sources to gain a more holistic view of sales performance.
- Regularly update the dashboard with new data to monitor trends over time.
